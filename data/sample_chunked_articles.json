            "Summary:\nSummary\n\nDraft Article 1 (Article 1 of Constitution of India 1950) was debated on 15 and 17 November 1948, and 17 and 18 September 1949. The Draft Article declared India as a ‘Union of States’ and went on to define India’s territory.\nMost members were confused as to why India was described as a ‘Union of States’, instead of a ‘Federation’ which was more appropriate. While presenting the Draft Constitution on an earlier date, the Drafting Committee Chairman had explained that ‘Union of States’ was used to ensure and clarify that States did not have the right to secede from India.\nA Member wanted to rename ‘India‘ to ‘Bharat’ as the latter had more historical pedigree. Another Member introduced an amendment to use both ‘India’ and ‘Bharat’ in the Draft Article. The Drafting Committee Chairman had through an amendment, suggested that the Draft Article say ‘India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States’. Except for one member who found the phrasing inelegant, the amendment won the support of the house.\nThe Assembly rejected all amendments to the Draft Article except those introduced by Drafting Committee Chairman. It adopted the Draft Article on 18 September 1949."

            "Summary:\nSummary\n\nDraft Article 2 (Article 2) was debated on 5 and 17 November 1948. It empowered Parliament to make laws to admit or establish states to the Union.\nOne member believed that ‘State’ should be clearly defined in order to ensure uniform interpretation in the Constitution. He argued that the Draft Constitution in its current form uses ‘state’ indiscriminately in myriad forms. However, ‘State’ must be defined to always connote ‘a kind of sovereignty’. He proposed to retain old expressions such as ‘Provinces, Indian States and Chief Commissioners’ Provinces’.\nHe argued that Draft Articles 2 and 3 overlap and moved a proposal to substitute them with a single Article. He opined that the purpose of Draft Article 2 was achieved by Draft Article 3 (Article 3), and having two separate Articles was redundant. However, his amendment was not accepted.\nThe Assembly adopted Draft Article 2 without amendments on 17 November 1948."

            "Summary:\nSummary\n\nArticle 3 (Draft Article 3) was debated on 17 and 18 November 1948, and 13 October 1949. It empowered Parliament to make law relating to the formation of new states and alteration of existing states.\nOne member strongly believed that the proposal to alter an existing State must originate from the concerned State Legislature and not the parliament. The State Legislature and the people residing in a State must be consulted and involved in this decision. He further argued that a ‘democratic regime’ must consult the stakeholders of a decision and not merely impose top-down orders. The Draft Article in its current form compromised federalism and granted unnecessary and excessive powers to the Centre.\nNot all were convinced by these arguments. Another member pointed out that this proposal would stifle minority demands for separate states as it would be impossible to get a State to support its own separation. Further, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee found this proposal unnecessary in light of an amendment moved by him. Through the amendment, he sought to include a clause requiring the President to consult with the concerned states prior to passing any law under this Article.\nThe Assembly adopted Draft Article 3 with amendments as moved by the Drafting Committee."
